# How to love math with C++ 🧮➕C➕➕=❤️
## Introduction

Welcome to how-to-love-math-with-cpp — a hands-on journey through mathematics, powered by modern C++.

This project is not just a collection of algorithms or formulas. It’s a structured exploration of mathematical ideas
implemented from scratch, with clarity, correctness, and clean engineering practices in mind.

The goal is simple:

>To understand mathematics deeply by building it.

Instead of treating math as an abstract theory, we translate it into working code — designing clean abstractions, writing
modular components, and validating everything with tests.
## What You'll Find Here
This repository combines multiple mathematical domains, including
* Complex Numbers
Representation, arithmetic operations, polar form, exponential, and operator overloading.
* Linear Algebra
Vectors, matrices, transformations, determinants, and possibly numerical methods.
* Number Theory
GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic, prime-related algorithms, and foundational discrete mathematics.
* Additional Topics
Probability, combinatorics, numerical methods, or anything that strengthens mathematical intuition through
implementation.

Each module is written with:
* Clear structure
* Modern C++ (C++20+)
* Clean separation of concerns
* Unit tests
* Emphasis on readability and correctness

## Why This Project Exists

Mathematics often feels intimidating because it is presented symbolically and abstractly.

C++ changes that.

When you:
*	implement complex numbers yourself,
*	write your own matrix multiplication,
*	build modular arithmetic from scratch,

you stop memorizing formulas — and start understanding structure.

This project is about transforming math from something you “learn” into something you build.

## Philosophy
* No black boxes.
* unnecessary shortcuts.
* Understand first, optimize second.
* Write code that explains the math.
* Write math that improves the code.
